# workday-scheduler-app
This application consisted of creating a scheduler where the user could save the tasks required to do in a regular work day.

In the html file, nine columns were created and the classes that were pre-established in the css file were included. 

With the Java Script code, the user is able to write on the row for each hour and save the task in the local storage. 

When the page refreshes the last activities that were added are shown in the page.

The application classifies the time blocks with 3 different colors. If the hour the user is at teh current time the block turns red, if the time is in the past, the blocks turn grey and if the time is in the future, the blocks turn green.

Here is a screenshot of the final application:
