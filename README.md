# workday-scheduler-app
This application consisted of creating a scheduler where the user could save the tasks required to do in a regular work day.

The user is able to write on the row for each established hour and save the task in the local storage. 

When the page refreshes the last activities that were saved are shown in the page.

The application classifies the time blocks with 3 different colors. If the user is at the current time the block turns red, if the the hour is being referred to is in the past, the blocks turn grey, and if the hour is in the future, the blocks turn green.

Here is a screenshot of the final application:
