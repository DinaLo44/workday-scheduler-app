# workday-scheduler-app
This application consisted of creating a scheduler where the user could save the the tasks required to do in a regular work day.

In the html file, nine columns were created with the classes that were pre-established in the css file. 

With the Java Script code, the user is able to write on the row for each hour and save the task in the local storage. 

When the page refreshes the last activities that were added are shown in the page.

The application classifies with 3 different colors if the hour the user is at is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).

Here is a screenshot of the final application:
